ðŸ“„Book Management System - Requirements Document
Project Overview
The Book Management System is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
application that allows users to manage a collection of books. The system will provide
features to add, edit, delete, and search books, along with additional functionalities like
organizing books using tabs and allowing image uploads for each book.
Features & Functionalities
Core Features (CRUD Operations)
Add a Book: Users can enter book details and upload an image. The form will open in a
modal.
Edit a Book: Clicking "Edit" will open a modal with the book's details pre-filled.
Delete a Book: Books can be removed from the list.
View Books: Books are displayed in a tabbed layout (e.g., "All Books", "Favorites",
"Unread", "Read").

Additional Functionalities
Search as You Type: Books will be filtered in real-time as users enter search keywords.
Tabs for Organizing Books:
â€¢ All Books (default)
â€¢ Favorites (books marked as favorite)
â€¢ Unread (books marked as unread)

â€¢ Read (books that have been read)
Book Cover Image Upload: Users must upload a book cover image when adding a book.
Data Structure & Storage
Book Object Structure (Stored in Local Storage)
Each book will be stored as an object in an array inside localStorage.
{
id: "1a2b3c", // Unique ID for each book
title: "JavaScript Essentials",
author: "John Doe",
genre: "Programming",
status: "Unread", // Options: "Read", "Unread"
favorite: false, // Boolean value
image: "image-url" // Local base64 or file path
}
